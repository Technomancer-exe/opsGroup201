### Project Description

**A tiny new space startup looking to build and deploy micro-satellites.**
- The company has mostly been hardware and software engineers working out of a large converted garage space.
- They have received some grants and some investments, and they want to expand to hire more engineers, but also a few non-technical employees such as an office manager, a media person, etc.
- Most employees will continue to work out of a central location, but both technical and non-technical users will sometimes need to travel.
- Information security is a priority: The company's only value is its intellectual property. The company is unwilling to allow these technical designs to be stored on the cloud, and does not want any of it's intellectual property to leave the building (except in the form of offsite backups).
